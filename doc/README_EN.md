**Modification 1**: Update the path to Potplayer's main program(potplayer 播放器的路径) to match your local path.

**Modification 2**: Specify the name of your note-taking software(笔记软件的程序名称).

- `Note`: The backlink will only be pasted into one note-taking software, following the order from top to bottom.
- For example, if both Obsidian and Typora are configured:
  - Case 1: If both Obsidian and Typora are open, the backlink will only be pasted into Obsidian.
  - Case 2: If only Typora is open, the backlink will be pasted into Typora.

## 2. Usage

1. Open `markdown2potplayer`.
2. Open Obsidian.
3. Open Potplayer.

4. When the note-taking software or Potplayer window is active, press the hotkey <b style="color:red">Alt+G (default)</b> to automatically paste the **video backlink** (视频回链) into Obsidian.
5. When the note-taking software or Potplayer window is active, press the hotkey <b style="color:red">Ctrl+Alt+G (default)</b> to automatically paste the **image + video backlink** into Obsidian.

## Modifying Templates

![image-20231229004156479](../assets/image-20231229004156479.png)

There are `5` template items for **pasting templates**.

**Note**: Not all positions can use these four items.

- Subtitle Template: Only `{subtitle}` can be used.
- Backlink Name: Only `{name}` and `{time}` can be used.
- Backlink Template: Only `{title}` can be used.
- Video Backlink Template: Only `{image}` and `{title}` can be used.

Explanation:

- `{name}`: Represents the video file name, i.e., `[Video **Name**]`.
- `{time}`: Represents the current playback time of the video, i.e., `[Video **Time**]`.
- `{title}`: **Represents the entire Markdown format link**, e.g., `[google](https://www.google.com)`. This means that this is the Markdown format backlink for Potplayer.
- `{image}`: Represents the **position for pasting the image**.
- `{subtitle}`: represents the subtitles that can be copied from the video currently being played in PotPlayer.
- `{subtitleTemplate}`: represents the subtitle template. **If there are no subtitles in the currently playing video, no data will be generated for the subtitle template**, meaning if there are no subtitles, `{subtitleTemplate}` will disappear.

Subtitle Template Variables:
- `{time}`: Current timestamp in PotPlayer
- `{subtitle}`: Currently displayed subtitle in PotPlayer
- `{subtitleOrigin}`: Original subtitle text at current timestamp from .srt file
- `{subtitleTimeRange}`: Time range in .srt file (format: HH:MM:SS-HH:MM:SS)
- `{subtitleTimeStart}`: Start time in .srt file (e.g. 00:01:02)
- `{subtitleTimeEnd}`: End time in .srt file (e.g. 00:03:04)

**Note**: The data styling in `SRT-to-Markdown` conversion is controlled by these template variables.


### Example 1

I want the effect of `Alt+G` to be this:

![image-20231216234628300](../assets/image-20231216234628300.png)

This should be filled in as follows:

1. First, determine the **name inside the `[]` of the backlink**:

```
{name} | {time}
```

2. Then, determine the **data for the entire template**:

````
```Video
title: {title}
```
````

Final effect:

![image-20231229004839082](../assets/image-20231229004839082.png)

### Example 2

I want the effect of `Ctrl+Alt+G` to be this:

![image-20231216235029002](../assets/image-20231216235029002.png)

The video backlink template should be filled in as follows:

````ini
```video
title:{title}
image:{image}
```
````

## Playing Bilibili Videos

1. Potplayer needs to have the plugin installed: [chen310/BilibiliPotPlayer](https://github.com/chen310/BilibiliPotPlayer).
2. Follow the plugin's usage documentation to play videos in Potplayer.
3. Use the hotkey to mark timestamps.


## Subtitle Navigation

Requirements:
- An SRT file with identical name as the video must exist in the same directory  
  (e.g. `test.mp4` requires `test.srt`)

Navigation Modes:
- **Single-play**: Jump to previous/current/next subtitle line based on current timestamp
- **Loop-mode**: Continuously cycle through previous/current/next subtitle lines

Native PotPlayer Shortcuts:
- `Home`: Previous dialogue line
- `End`: Next dialogue line  
- `Ctrl+Home`: Jump to start timestamp of current subtitle


## AB Segments

**Usage**:

1. Press the hotkey once to record the start point.
2. Press the hotkey again to record the end point and generate the backlink, which is then inserted into the note-taking software.

**Note

**:

1. When the start point is **greater than** the end point, e.g., start point 05:00, end point 01:00, the start and end points will be **swapped**, so the start point becomes 01:00 and the end point 05:00.
2. If you press the hotkey for the start point and **want to cancel**, press `Esc`.

### AB Segment

Play **once**, start playing at the start point, and pause at the end point.

After playing, if you don't want to pause at the end point, press `Esc` to cancel the end point pause.

### AB Loop

Use Potplayer's built-in "AB Section Loop" for **infinite playback**.

**To close the AB section loop**: Use Potplayer's **default hotkey `\`**.

## Video File Extensions

Control whether the file name includes the file extension.

![image-20231216154341755](../assets/image-20231216154341755.png)

## URL Encoding

Control whether the video URL is encoded.

**Effect of disabling encoding**:

![image-20231214195533699](../assets/image-20231214195533699.png)

Note:

- Known bugs:
  - Full URL encoding bug: If the path contains `\[` or `\!`, in **Obsidian's preview mode** (where the backlink is automatically URL-encoded by Obsidian), `\[` will lose the `\` and become `[`. For example: `G:\BaiduSyncdisk\123\[456]789.mp4` becomes `G:\BaiduSyncdisk\123[456]789.mp4` under the bug, so even if encoding is disabled, `\[` in the path will be forcibly encoded. To avoid this, please do not name your video files this way, or use `-`, `_`, etc., as alternatives.
  - After disabling encoding, if the video path contains `spaces`, the backlink will **not render as a link** in Obsidian's preview mode, so spaces will also be forcibly encoded. To avoid this, you can remove spaces from the file name or use `-`, `_`, etc., as alternatives.
- There may be other symbols with similar issues, but none have been discovered so far.

## Why isn't the seek time always precise?
This happens because Potplayer adjusts the timing based on keyframes after seeking, which may cause slight inaccuracies.
You can fix this by disabling this feature in Potplayer's settings.
